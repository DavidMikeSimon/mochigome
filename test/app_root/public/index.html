<p>
Welcome to the Mochigome demo app (which also serves as the app used in the unit tests).
</p>

<p>
The code in Mochigome itself is moderately clean, but this demo app's view and controller
code is quite messy, so be careful if you decide to copy it into your own app and adapt.
Furthermore, a lot of this demo app code will eventually be moved into some API-type stuff
in the library proper.

Anyways: <a href="/report">on to the demo!</a>
