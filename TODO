- For context of narrowing aggregations: cannot just consider join models that the main query passed through. For example, that would prevent student attendance aggregation from working correctly when dividing it up among classes.
- When generating association graph, could adopt a strategy to follow only belongs_to associations to make life easier (i.e. no dealing with possible plurality or through-queries)
- Still need some way to filter queries by weird stuff (i.e. EffectivelyDatedAssociation)
  - Maybe can do this by adjusting the EffectivelyDated module so that when included it calls a hook on Ernie that describes the possible filter on the effectively dated object (i.e. SectionRoster) as an SQL snippet referencing "SectionRoster" typed entries of the effective dates table.
- Do as few queries as possible to accomplish stuff; this also encourages app to rely on SQL's 'IN' syntax and magical grouping/joining abilities to make aggregation easier
- Replace all the TODOs and FIXMEs with whatever they're asking for (additional checks, use of ordered indifferent hashes instead of arrays of hashes, etc.)
