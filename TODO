- Fix JSAS AttendanceRecord so that it belongs_to SectionRoster rather than to both Student and Section. Otherwise it'll be out of context for aggregating on properly.
- Still need some way to filter queries by weird stuff (i.e. EffectivelyDatedAssociation, or to filter AttendanceRecords by the dates on the Sessions that they belong_to)
  - Maybe can do this by adjusting the EffectivelyDated module so that when included it calls a hook on Mochigome that describes the possible filter on the effectively dated object (i.e. SectionRoster) as an SQL snippet referencing "SectionRoster" typed entries of the effective dates table.
- Do as few queries as possible to accomplish stuff; this also encourages app to rely on SQL's 'IN' syntax and magical grouping/joining abilities to make aggregation easier
- Replace all the TODOs and FIXMEs with whatever they're asking for (additional checks, use of ordered indifferent hashes instead of arrays of hashes, etc.)
