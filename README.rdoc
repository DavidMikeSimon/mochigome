== Overview

Mochigome builds sophisticated report datasets from your ActiveRecord models.

== Why "Mochigome"?

It means "sticky rice", a kind of rice where the grains tend to clump together. The Mochigome gem makes a bunch of ActiveRecord models clump together to form a single comprehensive report.
